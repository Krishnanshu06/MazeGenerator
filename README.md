This program will use Search Algorithm to generate a randomized maze of desired size with one end and one start , the maaze conditions are:
- Must haev one finish and one Start
- Must not have areas with 4 empty cells in a square
- Must have borders
- Uses Search Algorithm


Supposed to do:
- This code is supposed to take a input of no. of rows and columns and the start and end position of the maze.
- The code first creates a full maze will only walls (#)
- Now the code takes the start pos as a initial node(miner in this case)
-
